#AfterSearchWE
====

This project is aimed at replacing SearchWP.

## About
AfterSearchWE is a FireFox add-on which makes your web browsing much faster and easier. It is very common task that you enter some keywords into the Google search bar to find information, and click the link to the page you deserve. But the page is sometimes quite long, in particular if the page is a forum or a mailing list archive. In this case, you choose ‘Edit’->’Find’ from the main menu, or type Ctrl-F to summon the ‘Find’ bar. If you want to find the keyword in the page, you have to type the keyword in the field or copy & paste from the Google search bar.

With this add-on, you no longer have to use the "Find" bar. When you move the cursor to top of the page, every keyword is displayed as a button in the "AfterSearch" bar. So you can click the button to find the keyword in the page currently displayed!

## Requirement
This add-on can used on Windows, GNU/Linux and macOS.
